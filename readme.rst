reStructuredText to LectureDoc\ :math:`^2` (``rst2ld``)
========================================================

`rst2ld` enables the conversion of lecture slides authored in `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__ to `LectureDoc2 <https://github.com/Delors/LectureDoc2>`__ format.



Setup a Project
----------------------

1. create a directory in which you want to store your slides; e.g., ``mkdir slides``
2. change to the director: ``cd slides``
3. initialize git: ``git init``
4. add the LectureDoc2 and restructuredTextToLectureDoc2 projects to the folder as submodules:
   
   - ``git submodule add https://github.com/delors/LectureDoc2``
   - ``git submodule add https://github.com/delors/reStructuredTextToLectureDoc2``
 


Setup a Project - Optional
----------------------------

1. add script to generate slides (https://github.com/Delors/Lectures/blob/main/gen-slides.zsh)
2. add "docutils.conf" when necessary (https://github.com/Delors/Lectures/blob/main/docutils.conf); i.e., if you have mathematical (``.. math::``) expressions in your slides and want to refer to a specific version of MathJax.
3. add .gitignore file with "\*.rst.html" if you don't want to archive the generated web pages



Generating PDFs
--------------------

In general, PDFs are generated by converting the HTML files to PDFs using a browser. As of 2024 Safari has the best support for printing HTML to PDF (don't use the ``Export as PDF...`` feature; use ``Print`` â†’ ``PDF``). Chrome works in most cases reasonably well, Firefox often fails miserably.

A script (https://github.com/Delors/Lectures/blob/main/gen-pdfs-from-slides.zsh) for generating PDFs using Safari on Mac OS (v. 14.4.1) is available. This script requires that LectureDoc is found in the ``LectureDoc2`` subfolder. This script basically automates Safari by simulating user input. Hence, while the script is running you should not use you Mac.
